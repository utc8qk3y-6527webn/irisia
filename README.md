# project irisia (crm platform)
This is the development base for “irisia,” a task management CRM system for creators. It consolidates technical implementations such as the interface, member database, login/logout functionality, and security.

This is a medium-to-long-term plan. We will gradually add to and update it. We anticipate service expansion in Japanese-speaking regions, English-speaking regions, and globally.
